      "source": "## Arithmetic Expression Examples\n\nArithmetic expressions are fundamental in mathematics and programming. They involve mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\n\n1. Addition:\n   - Example: `10 + 3`\n   - Result: `13`\n\n2. Subtraction:\n   - Example: `2 - 14`\n   - Result: `-12`\n\n3. Multiplication:\n   - Example: `5 * 6`\n   - Result: `30`\n\n4. Division:\n   - Example: `10 / 4`\n   - Result: `2.5`\n\n5. Mixed Operations:\n   - Example: `4 + 3 * 2`\n   - Result: `10`\n     Explanation: According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication is performed before addition. So, `3 * 2` is evaluated first, resulting in `6`, which is then added to `4`, giving the final result of `10`.\n\n6. Parentheses for Priority:\n   - Example: `(18 + 2) * 4`\n   - Result: `80`\n     Explanation: By using parentheses, we can control the order of operations. In this example, `18 + 2` is evaluated first, resulting in `20`, which is then multiplied by `4` to obtain `80`.\n",
